# HERMES - PupilLabs Core

Support package to interface the [Pupil Labs Core](https://pupil-labs.com/products/core) commercial smartglasses in [HERMES](https://github.com/maximyudayev/hermes).

## Options

### `core`
Obtains all data generated by the OEM [Pupil Capture](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/getting-started/) application, i.e. video, gaze, blinks, fixations, etc.

#### Pros
* Simple out-of-the-box install
* Visual configuration in the OEM GUI
* [Network API](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/developer/network-api/) through [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) to other LAN devices

#### Cons
* Lower video frame rate
* Heavy resource utilization for constrained devices (w/ or w/o GUI)
* More difficult to add custom realtime gaze processing
* Reprocessing gaze data in setups with poor realtime results with OEM algorithms (because of occlusions, reflections, shape face) don't guarantee better results on lossy videos

### `uvc`
Interfaces cameras directly using [pyuvc](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyuvc). Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyuvc/blob/master/WINDOWS_USER.md) on Windows to update the USB driver of the device to work as expected.

#### Pros
* Full stable frame rate
* Low resource utilization
* Cross-platform
* Constrained device friendly
* Flexibility to add own realtime algorithms

#### Cons
* Doesn't provide out-of-the-box GUI
* Requires custom realtime algorithms if gaze data is desired

## Installation
Both options available under the same namespace `hermes.pupillabs` package upon installation, as `PupilCoreProducer` or `PupilUvcProducer`, respectively.

### From PyPI
```bash
pip install pysio-hermes-pupillabs
```

### From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maximyudayev/hermes-pupillabs.git
pip install -e hermes-pupillabs
```

## Usage
Using the device follows the standard [configuration file specification](https://maximyudayev.github.io/hermes/) process of HERMES nodes.
